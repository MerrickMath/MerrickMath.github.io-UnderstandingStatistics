For this simulation, we will be simulating a moodified version of *Unstable Unicrons*. In this game each player is dealth 7 random cards, from a deck that contains 20 instant cards, 25 upgrade cards, 25 downgrade cards, 5 magic cards, 10 magical unicorn cards, and 15 basic unicorn cards. Mr. Merrick is supprised when his hand contains 5 Unicorn cards off the deal. Estimate the probability of this happening using simulation (use a minimum of 1000 simulations).
