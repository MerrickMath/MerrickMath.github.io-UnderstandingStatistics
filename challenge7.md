For this challange you will use the avocado data set. I would like you (a) to compare the price distributions for organic vs. non-organic avocados, and (b) show how avacado prices have increased over time. Your results must be summarized in a polished report, where all visulaiztions/calculations are clearly explained. 

Some relevant columns in the dataset:
* Date - The date of the observation
* AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
* type - conventional or organic
* year - the year
* Region - the city or region of the observation
* Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
* 4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
* 4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
* 4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold
