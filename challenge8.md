A platoon of stormtroopers are gathered for training. In the Death Star's shooting range the troopers are firing blasters at targets from 10 meters away. Stormtroopers are notoriously bad shots. Suppose that on average single a stormtrooper makes one out of five shots.

Suppose that each stormtrooper is given 15 shots, create a simulation to determine the expected number of shots a stormrooper will make. Your algorithm must be able to run over any number of simulations. Your results must be presented clearly in report format.
