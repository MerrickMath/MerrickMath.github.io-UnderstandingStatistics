For your analysis you will use the **youtube dataset**. 

* First I would like you to visualize the distribution for the number of likes a youtube video gets, and the number of views a youtube video gets. In detail I would like you to describe the shape of each distribution, along with all summary statistics. 
* Next I would like to to examine the distribution for the ratio between views, and likes. 
* Next I would like you to estimate the probability of someone choosing a video as popular as the Globglogabgalab at random from the pool of all youtube videos. Is it likely to have a video this popular?  

This challenge must be completed by the end of class on **March 9**. Results must be shown to Mr. Merrick in class to gain XP.
