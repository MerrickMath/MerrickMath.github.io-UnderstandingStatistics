Many of the challenges will require the use of R Studio. If you want to download this on your home computer you must first download base R <a href="https://www.r-project.org"> here </a> and then use <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"> this link </a> to download R Stuido. This can be a little confusing. I can give you a more thourough explanation in class. If you want to try on your own I encourage you to get your parents to help install the program at home. Haveing R Studio installed will be **extremely helpful**, as it will allow you to conduct analysis from home.
